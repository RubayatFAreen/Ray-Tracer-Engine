This project involves the development of a ray tracer in C++ to render 3D scenes. The ray tracer uses geometric transformations, linear algebra, and principles of light theory to simulate the interaction of light with objects. It calculates the color of each pixel by tracing the path of light rays as they travel through the scene, accounting for reflection, refraction, and shadows.

Key Features:

Geometric Transformations: Supports translation, rotation, and scaling of objects within the scene.

Linear Algebra: Utilizes vector and matrix operations to calculate intersections, reflections, and other necessary computations.

Light Theory: Implements models for diffuse and specular reflection, refraction, and shadows to produce realistic images.

Recursive Ray Tracing: Handles multiple levels of reflections and refractions to capture complex light interactions.

Anti-Aliasing: Reduces jagged edges in the rendered image by averaging the colors of adjacent pixels.
